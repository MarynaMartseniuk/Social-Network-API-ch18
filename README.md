 an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

## Description
### Motivation to create this App was a wish to learn noSQL DB on an social App example, which is wide used in real life.
### I built this App because it had some new coding challanges needed to be solved. For me, as for a begginer, it was importent to get a new skills and got understanding that "I can do it!".
### This App helps with 
- save and share your thoughts;
- get reactions on your thoughts from other users;
- create/udate a friend groups to share thoughts inside.
  
### This project was interesting and usefull for me because, as a begginer, I learned:
- MONGO DB (noSQL DB);
- backEnd sructure for MONGO DB;
- how to work with subdocs;
- how to optimize workflow using data population.
